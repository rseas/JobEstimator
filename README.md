# Job Estimator

Job Estimator is an application developed directly for A&A Renovations and Construction LLC. The app's main functionality is to simplify and streamline the process of giving an estimate for a possible contracted job. The user is able to open the application at the site and quickly give a cost estimation for the job requested by a potential client.

## Current Version

Currently, there are three types of jobs supported by the application, more specifically: additions, bathroom rennovations, and deck jobs.  This application is made primarily for usage on an IPad.

# Functions

Client will be able to enter application and fill in required fields.  The app will then compute the estimate based on entered data.
