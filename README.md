# Job Estimator

Job Estimator is an application developed directly for A&A Renovations and Construction LLC. The app's main functionality is to simplify and streamline the process of giving an estimate for a possible contracted job. The user is able to open the application at the site and quickly give a cost estimation for the job requested by a potential client.

## Current Version

Currently, there are three types of jobs supported by the application, more specifically additions, bathroom rennovations, and deck jobs as per the client's request.  This application is made primarily for usage on an IPad.
